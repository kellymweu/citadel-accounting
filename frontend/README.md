// Designing a Chart of Accounts (COA) with a logical structure and clear hierarchy is crucial for effective financial management. Here's a suggested structure for a Chart of Accounts using a 4-digit account numbering system:

// ### Suggested Chart of Accounts Structure

//      - 1030: Inventory
//      - 1040: Prepaid Expenses
//    - **Fixed Assets (1100-1199)**
//      - 1110: Equipment
//      - 1120: Furniture
//      - 1130: Vehicles
//      - 1140: Accumulated Depreciation
//    - **Other Assets (1200-1299)**

// ### Example Chart of Accounts

// | Account Code | Account Name            | Account Type |
// |--------------|--------------------------|--------------|
// | 1000         | Cash                     | Asset        |

// | 1020         | Accounts Receivable      | Asset        |
// | 1100         | Equipment                | Asset        |
// | 2010         | Accounts Payable         | Liability    |

// ### Key Considerations

// 1. **Consistency**: Ensure that account codes are used consistently across financial statements and reports.
// 2. **Clarity**: Each account should be clearly defined to avoid confusion.
// 3. **Flexibility**: The structure should be flexible enough to accommodate future changes or additions.
// 4. **Hierarchy**: The account numbering system should reflect the hierarchy of accounts, making it easy to understand relationships and summarize balances.
